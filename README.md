# eduTEAMS authentication backend

This is the eduTEAMS authentication backend implemented based on 
[Python Social Auth](https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For using it, please refer to
the [documentation](https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/index.html) to see how to add a new
backend to an existing framework.

This implementation is verified with django-2.2.0. It should work for other Django versions and frameworks, but still
not tested/verified.
